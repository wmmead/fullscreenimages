Examples of how to include full screen images for responsive websites.

Download the files and open them with your code editor and browser. The information about what these files do and how to work with them is baked right into them. 

The first file has a background image just set to a specific height and width. It will only be full screen if your screen happens to be 1200px wide.

The second file shows how to use background cover to make images full screen. However, with this method, they are likely to be cropped.

The third file shows how to scale the background images with the browser, so they are not cropped. 

The fourth file shows how to make images completely cover the screen, regardless of screen size.

The fifth file tackles techniques for optimizing images and making sure only smaller images load at smaller screen sizes.

Note this project is for CSS background images only, not for images in your content using an img tag.
